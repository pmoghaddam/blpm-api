# Overview
API layer of BLPM application.

# Quick Start

    # Install NPM modules, Bower packages, and any post-compilation
    npm install

    # Start server and watch folders for development
    grunt

# Evolutionary Architecture
Initially, this will be the API layer and backend layer. However, careful attention
should be made to keep these two layers coded modularly for a future inevitable separation.

# Tasks
* Setup CoffeeScript
* Setup Grunt
* Add Nodemon
* Setup Testing
* Incorporate effective MEAN skeleton structure into application
